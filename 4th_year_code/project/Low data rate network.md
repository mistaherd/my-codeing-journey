## what
- A network system that connects two or more computing devices for transmitting and sharing information
- The idea is to make a mesh  network  and transmit  data with forward error correction with a focus on the encoding and the network setup
- What is a  mesh network
## what I did?
I looked for multiple  papers to see who has done work  on this in the past 
looked at multiple  YouTube video and paper found that they used  from 900mhZ to  2.4GHZ

look at amazon  for 900mhz  module  i came across the following:

1. FrSky 900MHz R9M 2019 Long Range Module System Compatible R9 Series (ACCST/Access)
2.  HiLetgo NRF905 Wireless Transceiver Module PTR8000+ 433/486/915MHz with Antenna NF905SE
3.  REYAX RYLR896 Lora Module SX1276 UART 868MHz 915MHz Antenna at Command FCC NCC
4. 

## how

- First  research RF(Radio Frequency) and ones that  
-  using [[Forward error Correction]] to each of the nodes
- I plan on using  a raspier pie as a master on and Arduino  Uno as slaves 
## when 
## why
